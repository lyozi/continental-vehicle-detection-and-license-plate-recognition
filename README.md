# continental-vehicle-detection-and-license-plate-recognition
 â€‹This repository contains a machine learning model designed for accurate detection and recognition of vehicles and their license plates in road images. Developed using advanced algorithms such as YOLO (You Only Look Once), the model operates in real-time to identify vehicles and extract license plate information. A distinctive feature of this project is its ability to process consecutive image frames, enabling tracking and data fusion for enhanced recognition accuracy. This involves tracking vehicles or license plates across frames and aggregating data to accurately determine license plate characters or vehicle positions. The implementation utilizes frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch, with hyperparameter tuning to optimize performance. Evaluation metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score are employed to assess the model's effectiveness, with a particular focus on improving character recognition accuracy for reliable vehicle identification. This project contributes to the advancement of autonomous vehicles and Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS), aiming to enhance road safety and traffic efficiency.  This project was developed in collaboration with Continental Autonomous Mobility Hungary
